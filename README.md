# Advanced Fluid Mechanics
## Study of advanced Fluid Mechanics topics with Jupyter Notebooks 

These Jupyter Notebooks are the collection of topics studied in the subject 
"Advanced Fluid Mechanics" in the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya in 
Terrassa since 2020.

The aim is to introduce the students to the use of Python and 
Jupyter Notebooks for the solution of complex problems 
in Fluid Mechanics. The Notebooks are independent between them 
except for the Notebook _0 - Introduction to scientific computation with Python_,
 that introduces the main tools that are being used in the rest of Notebooks.

Each topic is studied with a special Python module 
(although there are some, as `matplotlib` that is used across most of them). 
For instance, in the topic of _Microflows 
and lubrication_, the use of `sympy` is specially important, 
whereas in _Turbulence_ is important `pandas` and in rheology, `scipy`.

The notebooks are quite interactive. 
The student can download them from GitHub and play with them in Jupyterlab,
 Google Colab or any other IDE that supports Python Jupyter Notebooks. 
Also there are some exercices for practicing and some Assignments 
that my students had to deliver in groups for grading. 

It is advisable to have basic knowledge of Fluid Mechanics before using 
the Notebooks. In the beginning of each Notebook a basic lecture 
on the subject is suggested.
